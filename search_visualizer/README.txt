Python project for visualizing sorting algorithms.
includes implementation of merge sort, selection sort, heap sort, quick sort, shaker sort, bubble sort, inserion sort
in ascending and descending order.
Project implements the pygame library for GUI functionality and visually portrays the sort transpiring in real time on a randomly generating array
of numbers to a specified n value which can be altered in code.
NOTE:
selection sort doesn't sort by minimal value, to be updated soon
merge sort function will be updated to be more efficient at run time
